    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Salmon dish is easy to make and delicious! My favorite part of this dish is how customizeable and creative you can get with the ingredients and sides. I use frozen Sockeye for simplicity, however fresh salmon would be preffered. Shoutout to Mama Rosa and Baba Housh.

        <li>Sockeye Salmon Filets</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set the oven to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Boil rice water</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt to the rice water, wait for it to boil</li>
        <li>While we wait for Oven and Rice, remove Salmon from packaging and pat dry</li>
        <li>Throw 2tbsp of butter into a microwave safe bowl and microwave for 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Grab container you will cook the salmon in, I used a pyrex oven safe container</li>
        <li>Spray the bottom of the pyrex in oil then place the salmon in the container with the skin down</li>
        <li>Stop here, add the rice, lower the heat to low, and set a timer</li>
        <li>Begin basting the salmon in butter. Try to coat the entire salmon</li>
        <li>Add preffered amount of salt and pepper to the top of the salmon</li>
        <li>Place garlic cloves on top of the salmon</li>
        <li>The salmon is now ready for the oven, it will take 12 minutes, so try to line this up with the rice</li>
        <li>Cook Salmon for 12 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook up some veggies on the stovetop/microwave. I use stir fry veggies and cook them on the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Add the components together and garnish with scallions, lemon, sesame seeds and your preffered sauce as you see fit</li>
         
    </ol>
